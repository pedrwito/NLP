      "1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\n",

      "\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n",

      "   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's\n",
      "   still there).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\n",
      "   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\n",
      "   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n",

      "that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\n",
      "step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\n",
      "described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\n",
      "to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\n",
      "permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\n",
      "very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\n",
      "hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\n",
      "people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\n",
      "shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\n",
      "there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\n",
      "lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\n",
      "There were no shots coming back from the government side.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\n",
      "asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\n",
      "I was given were the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\n",
      "federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\n",
      "quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\n",
      "needed in other parts of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\n",
      "never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\n",
      "that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\n",
      "be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\n",
      "members to come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\n",
      "to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\n",
      "the passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\n",
      "the children who were still inside the compound were being abused\n",
      "significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\n",
      "unsafe conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\n",
      "The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\n",
      "given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\n",
      "evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\n",
      "that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\n",
      "convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\n",
      "increase with the passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The third question I asked was, has the military been\n",
      "consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\n",
      "that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\n",
      "that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\n",
      "people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\n",
      "of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\n",
      "military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\n",
      "had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\n",
      "minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\n",
      "-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\n",
      "significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\n",
      "said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\n",
      "should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\n",
      "today.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Q  Mr. President --\n",
      "\n",
      "     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\n",
      "reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\n",
      "trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n",
      "\n",
      "     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\n",
      "reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\n",
      "reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\n",
      "add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\n",
      "late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\n",
      "had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\n",
      "custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\n",
      "to unfold.\n",
      "\n",
      "     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\n",
      "speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\n",
      "on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\n",
      "I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\n",
      "King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\n",
      "is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\n",
      "happen when the federal government is in control.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\n",
      "would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\n",
      "Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\n",
      "murdered themselves.  (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\n",
      "life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\n",
      "people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\n",
      "heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\n",
      "and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\n",
      "avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\n",
      "themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\n",
      "children.\n",
      "\n",
      "     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\n",
      "is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\n",
      "to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\n",
      "you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\n",
      "said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\n",
      "children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\n",
      "unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\n",
      "with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\n",

      "somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \n",
      "for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \n",
      "words is that so important?\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \n",
      "First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \n",
      "have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \n",
      "them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \n",
      "continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \n",
      "research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \n",
      "forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \n",
      "over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \n",
      "schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \n",
      "taught before.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \n",
      "not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \n",
      "abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \n",
      "learning because we think that the best and most productive workers \n",
      "will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \n",
      "could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \n",
      "succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \n",
      "disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \n",
      "into the next year, is really even greater.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \n",
      "throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \n",
      "educational component of training.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \n",
      "Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \n",
      "or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \n",
      "education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \n",
      "for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \n",
      "geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \n",
      "working on something, and they can see the exact and direct \n",
      "application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \n",
      "lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \n",
      "education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \n",
      "It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \n",
      "young people even beyond the summer.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \n",
      "program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \n",
      "us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \n",
      "developing.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \n",
      "it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \n",
      "will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \n",
      "require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \n",
      "get in a high school diploma.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \n",
      "of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \n",
      "education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \n",
      "people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \n",
      "go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \n",
      "they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \n",
      "employers.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \n",
      "trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \n",
      "but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \n",
      "two years of further training either in a community college, a \n",
      "vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \n",
      "this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \n",
      "funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \n",
      "and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \n",
      "a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \n",
      "based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \n",
      "revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \n",
      "the earnings of American workers.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \n",
      "you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \n",
      "people watching this program -- that the business community and \n",
      "educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \n",
      "of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \n",
      "fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \n",
      "people watching this program probably are the ones who are most \n",
      "directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \n",
      "and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \n",
      "already out there.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \n",
      "about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \n",
      "career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \n",
      "with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \n",
      "these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \n",
      "you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \n",
      "longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \n",
      "community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \n",
      "doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \n",
      "Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \n",
      "kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \n",
      "aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \n",
      "in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \n",
      "helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \n",
      "develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \n",
      "one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \n",
      "players in a community come together and work together and cooperate \n",
      "together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \n",
      "the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \n",
      "is talking, but they're not really working together in a common \n",
      "strategy.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \n",
      "would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \n",
      "excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \n",
      "tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \n",
      "make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \n",
      "eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \n",
      "college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \n",
      "talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \n",
      "skills for on-the-job learning.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \n",
      "already being done.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \n",
      "point based on my personal experience at home -- the business \n",
      "community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \n",
      "the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \n",
      "but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \n",
      "of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \n",
      "going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \n",
      "second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \n",
      "influence them.  So I think that's very important.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \n",
      "the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \n",
      "funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \n",
      "sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \n",
      "quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \n",
      "determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \n",
      "course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \n",
      "program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \n",
      "long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \n",
      "President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \n",
      "communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \n",
      "coming forth before too long.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \n",
      "were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \n",
      "schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \n",
      "a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \n",
      "that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \n",
      "Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \n",
      "do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \n",
      "Congress that will actually define the things that the national \n",
      "government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \n",
      "children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \n",
      "goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \n",
      "ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \n",
      "graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \n",
      "confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \n",
      "second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \n",
      "disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \n",
      "them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \n",
      "life-long learning in this country.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \n",
      "state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \n",
      "role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \n",
      "introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \n",
      "and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \n",
      "is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \n",
      "that we need to meet.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \n",
      "like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \n",
      "Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \n",
      "money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \n",
      "partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \n",
      "it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \n",
      "of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \n",
      "support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \n",
      "efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \n",
      "the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \n",
      "course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \n",
      "I wonder if you would comment on that.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \n",
      "our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \n",
      "don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \n",
      "of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \n",
      "national skill standards to which they could aspire and which \n",
      "employers would understand as a national credential, many of these \n",
      "young people would actually find that they were much more eligible \n",
      "for jobs.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \n",
      "countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \n",
      "college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \n",
      "technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \n",
      "you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \n",
      "develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \n",
      "with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \n",
      "industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \n",
      "kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \n",
      "institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \n",
      "ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \n",
      "Todd of Austin, Texas.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Q\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \n",
      "Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \n",
      "have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \n",
      "have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \n",
      "simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \n",
      "much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \n",
      "very supportive.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \n",
      "summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \n",
      "have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \n",
      "as 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \n",
      "answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \n",
      "the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \n",
      "would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \n",
      "is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \n",
      "level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\n",
      "round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \n",
      "local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \n",
      "something that we believe is very important to success in this \n",
      "effort.\n",

      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \n",
      "answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \n",
      "and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \n",
      "I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \n",
      "structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \n",
      "program and that will move a lot of these young people back into \n",
      "schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \n",
      "the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \n",
      "try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \n",
      "to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \n",
      "working on that.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \n",
      "Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \n",
      "build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \n",
      "training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \n",
      "heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \n",
      "asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \n",
      "hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \n",
      "trained on a year-round basis.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \n",
      "a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \n",
      "as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \n",
      "actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \n",
      "they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \n",
      "hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \n",
      "we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \n",
      "cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \n",
      "raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \n",
      "able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n",

      "\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \n",
      "of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \n",
      "and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \n",
      "school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \n",
      "addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \n",
      "jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \n",
      "It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \n",
      "economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \n",

      "think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \n",
      "greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \n",
      "to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \n",

      "will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \n",
      "together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \n",
      "then the state, with all the various school districts, a very \n",

      "\n",
      "If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\n",
      "but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\n",
      "hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\n",
      "many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\n",
      "described as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\n",
      "follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\n",
      "incorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\n",
      "the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\n",
      "Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\n",
      "favour of prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \n",
      "the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \n",
      "comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \n",
      "is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\n",
      "argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \n",
      "evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \n",
      "cost-benefit analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n",
      "  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n",
      "     exist.\n",
      "  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n",
      "  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\n",
      "assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\n",
      "the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\n",
      "considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\n",
      "information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\n",
      "can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\n",
      "information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\n",
      "no \"cost\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\n",
      "problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\n",
      "Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\n",
      "argument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\n",
      "to believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\n",
      "intended the argument to be viewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\n",
      "omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\n",
      "a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\n",
      "whether people believe in him.\n",

      "Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \n",

      "more generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \n",
      "for what we see around us:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\n",
      "came into being as a result of natural processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \n",
      "there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \n",
      "of non-zero complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \n",
      "that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\n",
      "Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n",

      "\n",
      "Typical posting:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\n",
      "but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\n",
      "hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\n",
      "many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\n",
      "described as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\n",
      "follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\n",
      "incorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\n",
      "the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\n",
      "Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\n",
      "favour of prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \n",
      "the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \n",
      "comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \n",
      "is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\n",
      "argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \n",
      "evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \n",
      "cost-benefit analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n",
      "  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n",
      "     exist.\n",
      "  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n",
      "  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\n",
      "assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\n",
      "the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\n",
      "considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\n",
      "information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\n",
      "can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\n",
      "information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\n",
      "no \"cost\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\n",
      "problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\n",
      "Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\n",
      "argument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\n",
      "to believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\n",
      "intended the argument to be viewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\n",
      "omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\n",
      "a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\n",
      "whether people believe in him.\n",

      "\n",
      "William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \n",
      "Razor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \n",

      "\n",
      "2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \n",
      "there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \n",
      "of non-zero complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \n",
      "that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\n",
      "Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n",

Estas palabras aparecen solo por casualidad estadistica porque por ejemplo puede aparezcan en el mismo documento, por lo que el vector seria parecido. Luego tambien puede verse el caso de 'the' que es un articulo, y tiene gran similitud simplemente porque aparece delante de la palabra computer muy seguido mas que por una similitud semantica real.\n",

Espn y football por otro lado si son palabras con similitudes semanticas reales. El caso de tomorrow debe darse porque es una palabra que debe aparecer en contextos similares como 'tommorrow's game' o 'baseball tomorrow'. Esto sumado a que aparece en pocos documntos probablemente genera que parezca que hay una similitud que ni hay\n",

    "    Similar a baseball, tiene una mezcla de palabras que no tienen verdadera similitud de contenido y tienen una frecuencia de aparición en muy pocos documentos con palabras que si tienen relacion entre si. Romano y relelvant aparecen en solo 1-2 documentos, osea, aparecen solo por casualidad estadística porque probablemente aparecen en el mismo documento que contiene 'medical', por lo que el vector sería parecido. Por otro lado, 'hospitals' y 'providers' si son términos médicos reales, y tienen similitud alta porque aparecen en contextos médicos similares más que por coincidencia estadística. El caso de 'recuperation' es un hibrido, dado que es una palabra que debe aparecer en contextos médicos similares como 'medical recuperation' o 'recuperation period' pero no es necesariamente tan semanticamente similar, dado que podria tambien aparecer en muchisimos otros contextos (recuperacion de un equipo en un deporte, por ejemplo)\n",

    "    Sucede algo diferente que lo que pasaba para 'computer' y 'baseball'. Las palabras más similares incluyen principalmente términos religiosos reales como 'religious' y 'religions' que son derivaciones directas de la palabra original. Estas palabras tienen similitudes altas porque aparecen en contextos religiosos similares y comparten significado semántico real. El caso de 'crusades' debe darse porque es una palabra que aparece en contextos históricos-religiosos similares y ademas esta relacionado a la religion (son guerras religiosas). Solo 'purpsoe' aparece en un solo documento, mostrando que la mayoría de similitudes son semánticas reales más que coincidencias estadísticas.\n",

    "    Sucede algo similar a 'religion' donde la mayor parte de las palabras más similares son términos automotrices reales como 'cars', 'civic', 'owner' y 'dealer'. Estas palabras tienen similitudes moderadas pero reales porque aparecen en contextos automotrices similares y comparten significado semántico en el dominio de vehículos. Solo 'criterium' aparece en un solo documento, mostrando que la mayoría de similitudes son semánticas reales más que coincidencias estadísticas. El caso de 'civic' debe darse porque es un modelo de auto específico que aparece frecuentemente en discusiones sobre autos.\n"
